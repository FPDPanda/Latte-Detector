# Latte-Detector

A little program I made for the two week experience with Kenzie Academy
Anyone is more than welcome to help me! I made this little website (after about 5-6 hours of sweat and research) with all the knowledge I currently have, and EVERYONE is welcome to make any kind of changes that you think would improve!

# Improvements

- Separate the buttons into 3 groups and somehow manage to leave one button from each group selected
- A message saying which buttons have already been selected (which changes whenever the person clicks on another in the same category)
